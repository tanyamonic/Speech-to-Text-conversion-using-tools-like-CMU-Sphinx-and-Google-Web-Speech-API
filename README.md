# Speech-to-Text-conversion-using-tools-like-CMU-Sphinx-and-Google-Web-Speech-API

This project, *"Basic Speech-to-Text Conversion Using Open Source Tools,"* showcases how prerecorded and real-time speech can be transcribed into text using CMU Sphinx for offline and Google Speech API for cloud-based recognition. It features a two-layered fallback system with error handling, ambient noise adjustment, and live testing supportâ€”ideal for building reliable, voice-driven applications.
